This repository contains a Project realised by its three collaborators, in the context of the EPFL course CS-433 Machine Learning. We use the data found in \project1\data\dataset.zip composed of .csv files that contain the results of a 2015 survey by BRFSS. To use any Notebook in this repository please dowload locally and extract all the files in this folder.

This repository contains the main classifying models that determine, using answeres from the survey whether a respondant will suffer from a heart attack. The best performing model is found in run.ipynb. The Fox_I.ipynb and Fox_II.ipynb are an almost equivalent model with different approaches. It shows the evolution of this project more and contains an analysis of the model.

The directory \project1 contains other models, some which perform badly and were just exploratory such as the Model_NNeigh.ipynb and Model_selectData.ipynb and some evolutions of the best model. These are the OHE models they show why each step of run.ipynb was an improvement. It also contains all complementary functions used in run.ipynb and the Fox models.

Finally a short report summarizing the main findings can be found in the main directory.
